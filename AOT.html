    <h4>Armored Titan</h4>
    <p>The Armored Titan is a 15-meter class Titan from Attack on Titan, known for its ability to generate hardened, plated armor over its body for extreme durability against most attacks. While this armor is capable of withstanding cannon fire and high-speed blades, it significantly reduces the Titan's speed. This limitation can be overcome by selectively shedding the armor, particularly from the joints, to increase mobility. The user, Reiner Braun, can also use the armor to create sharp claws for scaling walls, or to charge and deliver powerful, high-impact blows. </p>

    <h4>Female Titan</h4>
    <p>The Female Titan from Attack on Titan is a 14-meter tall Titan with superhuman strength, speed, and endurance, known for its unique abilities: skin hardening and a screaming power that can attract other Titans. The only confirmed wielder is Annie Leonhart, a Marleyan warrior who uses her Titan for combat and to gather other Titans for a specific purpose. A unique capability of the Female Titan is its potential to mimic the abilities of other Titans by consuming parts of their bodies. </p>

    <h4>Colossal Titan</h4>
    <p>The Colossal Titan is the largest of the Nine Titans from the anime and manga Attack on Titan, known for its skinless, muscular body, immense size (around 60 meters tall), and the ability to release destructive steam and heat during transformation. It serves as a primary antagonist, capable of breaking through the Walls and causing mass destruction, though it is slow and lacks agility. </p>

    <h4>Cart Titan</h4>
    <p>The Cart Titan is one of the Nine Titans from Attack on Titan with remarkable endurance and speed, capable of remaining in its Titan form for months and transforming hundreds of times consecutively. It is unique for its quadrupedal, horse-like form and has a long, flat torso ideal for carrying cargo and weaponry. Its primary weaknesses are its relatively low defensive capabilities and slower regeneration compared to other Titans. </p>

    <h4>Jaw Titan</h4>
    <p>The Jaw Titan is one of the Nine Titans in Attack on Titan, known for its small size, exceptional speed, and powerful jaws and claws that can crush almost anything. Its abilities make it a potent assault unit. Previous inheritors include Marcel Galliard, Ymir, and Porco Galliard, while the most recent, Falco Grice, developed unique bird-like characteristics including wings, making his version the first and only flying Jaw Titan. </p>

    <img src="../../../Downloads/War-Hammer-Titan-Attack-on-Titan-header.avif" alt="Warhammer Titan">
    <h4>Warhammer Titan</h4>
    <p>The Warhammer Titan from Attack on Titan can create weapons and structures out of hardened Titan flesh, including its namesake warhammer, spikes, and flexible weapons like crossbows. Its user is encased in a crystal and can remotely control the Titan via a string of flesh, which makes the user invulnerable to capture as long as the crystal is intact and the string isn't severed. This unique control method makes the user's location irrelevant to the Titan's transformation location, but overusing the hardening ability can drain the user's stamina.  </p>

    <h2>Founding Titan</h2>
    <p>
      The Founding Titan is one of the Nine Titans in Attack on Titan with the power to create and control Titans and modify the memories and biology of Eldians. It was the first Titan, created from Ymir Fritz, and has the ability to unleash the full power of the Walls and the Rumbling. While a royal family member is needed to unlock its full potential, anyone who touches a royal-blooded individual can use its powers.
